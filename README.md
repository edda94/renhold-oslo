Hello guys, Iâ€™m building a website for my local cleaning company in Oslo, Norway called [Renhold Oslo](http://www.oslosrenhold.no)

It is a complete cleaning company who has been operating since 2010 with move out cleaning, house cleaning, commercial cleaning, carpet cleaning and so on. 

Recently, we started to engage with different onlineplatforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and meet up.com and managed to grow our business exponantially. We are now trying to grow our business further by building this new website of ours on [oslosrenhold.no](http://www.oslosrenhold.no)

So please, go in to our site and give us a review of what you think of the design and so on, or if you are a local house owner in oslo you are of course welcome to contact us for a free estimate of your house cleaning :)
